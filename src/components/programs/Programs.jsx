    <p>The integration of materials science, technology, and sustainability will be the theme of ICSMT 2024. In order to debate and share developments, research findings, and creative solutions in the field of sustainable materials and technologies, these conferences aim to bring together researchers, academics, industry experts, policymakers, and other stakeholders. The aim of this conference is to identify and fulfil the knowledge gap between materials and renewable energy, environmentally friendly materials for engineering applications, and materials for energy storage. With a focus on contributions that close the knowledge gap between materials and system designs, this conference seeks research articles in applied or basic science of nano-, micro-, meso-, and macro-scale aspects of materials and technologies for sustainable development. </p>
    <p>In order to advance a better knowledge of sustainable materials, their manufacture, and their design, this conference also intends to encourage scientists and technical specialists to publish their theoretical and analytical findings and/or simulations. It offers a platform for scientists like physicists, mathematicians, chemists, material scientists, engineers, biophysicists, biomedical engineers, tissue engineers, and other technical experts to combine their various fields of expertise in sustainability science and technology and contribute original works.</p>
